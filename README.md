Power monitor
=============


## Reasons to use this app

I personally feel that the operating systems do a poor job to notify the user when the battery is full and I created this app for that purpose.


## Installation 

### Pre-requisites
python 3.9 or higher

### Installation
Simply download the powermonitor.pex file and run the following command to start 

``` bash 
python powermonitor.pex start
```

To stop the application 

```bash 
python powermonitor.pex stop
```

To see if the application is running or not

``` bash 
python powermonitor.pex status
```
